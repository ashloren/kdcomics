            <h2>Can You Really Start Selling Kindle Comic Books In A Few Days And With A Few Dollars?</h2>
			<img width="786" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashloren/monapdx/main/Slide1.PNG">
            <p>Hey guys, Ashly Lorenzana here and I'm super excited to share this opportunity with you all today. </p>

<p>I was thinking about ways to make public domain books more interesting to a modern day audience and it hit me out of nowhere --- turn the stories into a comic book, of course!</p>

<p>That's exactly what I'm going to show you how to do in a moment. </p>

<p>And don't worry…
</p>
<h2>Everyone Knows How Lucrative Fiction Books Are, But Most Of Us Lack The Confidence To Take A Stab At Writing It</h2>

<p>Sound familiar? </p>

<p>Most of the people I know are terrified to move an inch away from non-fiction because they don't consider themselves "creative" types. </p>

<p>This is such nonsense!</p>

<p>Sometimes we have to take baby steps, as the saying goes. </p>

<p>That's what I'm going to help you do today. </p>

<p>This is the first baby step you will take towards making money with fiction books for Kindle and it's so easy that yes, even a baby could probably do it.</p>


<h2>Worried About The Costs Of Hiring A Graphic Designer Or An Illustrator?</h2>

<p>If you publish children's picture books, then you know how expensive an illustrator can be. </p>

<p>I've done one myself and I know how quickly it can add up. </p>

<p>Even Fiverr sellers start to dig into your wallet for longer books.</p>

<p>That's the beauty of this method --- you don't need an illustrator or fancy graphics. </p>

<p>Believe it or not, you don't even need graphics at all in some cases.</p>
